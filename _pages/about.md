Hello! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, working under [Dr. Tiffany Barnes](https://eliza.csc.ncsu.edu) and [Dr. DK Xu](https://dongkuanx27.github.io/).

I am passionate about using AI for social impact by developing scalable, human-centered technologies that address real-world needs and make educational resources more accessible and effective. Here are some key projects I'm involved in:

- **ChatLearn:** Creating a benchmark dataset of LLM-generated conversations for parental training in sexual health communication along with evaluation protocol for researchers.
- **[MerryQuery](https://exploremq.benyamintabarsi.com/):** Developing an AI chatbot that provides answers tailored to course materials and instructor preferences.
- **[LLMs in Classrooms](https://go.ncsu.edu/chatgpt-workshop):** Training teachers on how to integrate LLMs to enhance their teaching.
- **Developers and LLMs:** Studying how developers use LLMs to improve their work.

Another focus of my research is enhancing the learning experience of novice programmers by analyzing their coding patterns and creating intelligent support features.

I am always eager to collaborate with other researchers to develop tools that make learning easier and more effective. If you're interested in educational technology or AI, feel free to reach out!
